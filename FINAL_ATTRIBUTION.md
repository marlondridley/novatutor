## 🎤 Elevator Pitch for Interviews

```
"I'm Marlon Ridley, and I developed BestTutorEver, an AI learning 
platform that makes homework fun for kids. Think of it as a Nintendo 
Switch for education - kids use a game controller interface to interact 
with their AI tutor.

The challenge was making it kid-friendly while maintaining COPPA 
compliance and keeping AI costs low. I solved this by:

1. Creating a prompt-free AI control system using behavior flags
2. Reducing AI costs 95% by integrating DeepSeek
3. Designing a Nintendo Switch-style interface with Minecraft theming
4. Implementing full accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
5. Achieving an 88 Lighthouse performance score with PWA capabilities

It's built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, and Stripe, and 
it's production-ready with comprehensive testing and documentation."

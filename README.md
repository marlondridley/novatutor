## 💡 DeepSeek Context Caching

This application is optimized to take advantage of DeepSeek's **automatic context caching** feature, which significantly reduces API costs:

### How It Works

- **Automatic**: Caching is enabled by default, no code changes needed
- **Prefix Matching**: When message prefixes match between requests, they're served from cache
- **Storage Unit**: Uses 64-token cache units
- **Cost Savings**: Cache hits cost 0.1¥ per million tokens vs 1¥ for cache misses

### Our Optimization Strategy

We've centralized all system prompts in `src/ai/prompts.ts` to maximize cache hits:

```typescript
// Same system prompt across all tutoring requests = high cache hit rate!
export const TUTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an AI educational assistant...`;
```

**Example**: When multiple students ask math questions, the system prompt gets cached:

```typescript
// Request 1
messages: [
  { role: "system", content: TUTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT + "\nSubject: Math" },
  { role: "user", content: "Explain Pythagorean theorem" }
]

// Request 2 - System prompt is cached! ✅
messages: [
  { role: "system", content: TUTOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT + "\nSubject: Math" },
  { role: "user", content: "Help with quadratic equations" }
]
```

### Monitoring Cache Performance

Check API response for cache statistics:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 1500,    // Tokens served from cache (cheap!)
    "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 100     // Tokens computed (normal cost)
  }
}
```

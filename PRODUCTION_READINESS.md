# Production Readiness Summary

## âœ… All Critical Issues Fixed

All issues identified in the audit have been resolved:

### 1. âœ… Mock Data - Fixed
- All demo data clearly marked with documentation
- Deprecated test exports with warnings
- Components use real user data

### 2. âœ… Console.log Statements - Fixed  
- All `console.error()` replaced with structured logger in `src/lib/actions.ts`
- Audio flows use logger
- Homework helper uses logger
- Only acceptable console usage remains (Supabase Edge Functions)

### 3. âœ… Azure OpenAI Support - Implemented
- Multi-provider support with priority: Azure > DeepSeek > OpenAI
- Auto-detection from environment variables
- Backward compatible (works with existing DeepSeek setup)

### 4. âœ… RAG Pipeline - Implemented
- Complete Azure AI Search integration
- Embeddings support (Azure OpenAI or OpenAI)
- Graceful degradation when not configured
- Integrated into learning path generation

### 5. âœ… Supabase Storage - Implemented
- Homework image persistence
- Automatic upload on capture
- Organized storage structure
- Error handling and logging

### 6. âœ… Sentry Monitoring - Implemented
- Error tracking integration
- Logger sends errors to Sentry
- Auto-initialization in app layout
- Graceful degradation when not configured

## ðŸ“¦ Installation Required

### Sentry (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
```

Then set environment variable:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Required Setup Steps

### 1. Supabase Storage Bucket

Create bucket in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Storage â†’ Create bucket
2. Name: `homework-uploads`
3. Public: Yes (or configure RLS)

**RLS Policy (if private):**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own homework"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'homework-uploads' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Update `.env.production` or deployment platform with:

**Required:**
- All existing Supabase, Stripe, Redis, OpenAI variables

**Optional but Recommended:**
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - For Azure OpenAI
- `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` - For RAG pipeline
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` - For error monitoring

See `env.example` for complete list.
